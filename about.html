                        For the last several years, I have dedicated myself to becoming a developer. My focus is backend technologies, specificaly Java, Maven, Spring, database technologies and a number of services within AWS. I also have experience with frontend technologies, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JavaScript frameworks and libraries such as jQuery and React.

                        How did I get here? 
                    </h4>

                    <p>
                        Like most people, my journey into adulthood was marked by uncertainty. I didn't have a clear idea of what I wanted to do with myself. The one thing that I was sure of in my university days was that I wanted to major in physics. I found a lot of beauty in physics and wanted to learn much more about it for its own sake. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After graduating from university, I went down many paths in an effort to find myself. I worked at a very cool company called <a href="https://www.xemed.com/" target="_BLANK">Xemed</a> which creates devices used in medical experimentation. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2013, I left Xemed after a year to pursue a dream of mine to live in a foreign country. I had been studying Spanish for fun since 2010, and I stumbled upon an opportunity to work as an English-language teaching assistant in a Spanish school in Madrid. I found it too good an opportunity to pass up. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After 2 years in Madrid, I came back home to try my hand at teaching high school physics. It was a wonderful experience, and I was able to connect with my students and share my passions with them. However, teaching simply did not offer the kind of work-life balance I expect from a job, consuming most of my free time, so I again decided to look elsewhere. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Toward the end of my teaching experience, I underwent a revelation that I feel should have dawned on me long before. As a teen, I enjoyed working on websites for fun and leisure. I had a few programming courses late in college, which I greatly enjoyed. Why not try my hand at programming? I decided to try to find a tech company which offered me the opportunity to follow my dream. I subsequently found myself at <a href="https://www.dealer.com/" target="_BLANK">Dealer.com</a>, a subsidiary of Cox Enterprises, where I have been for the last several years. I have learned a lot there. Since I made my decision to become a developer, I have dedicated much of my free time toward becoming a developer. This has included poring over whatever tech literature I find that piques my interest. Aside from W3Schools and JavaTPoint deep-dives, I have completed a Java-based course series in data structures and algorithms offered by Princeton University. I have also completed some personal projects, which can be seen <a href="portfolio.html">here</a>.
